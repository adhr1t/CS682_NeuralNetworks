# CS682_NeuralNetworks
Assignments from my UMass MS CS 682 Neural Networks course.

- <ins>Assignment 1</ins>: builds fundamental Machine Learning algorithms like KNN, SVM, Softmax function, and a two layer Neural Network from scratch.
- <ins>Assignment 2</ins>: delves deep into Neural Networks by building foundational operators like Batch Normalization, Layer Normalization, and Dropout. It uses these operators in the creation of from-scratch Fully Connected Networks and Convolutional Networks. Learned skills are then applied to PyTorch and TensorFlow Machine Learning frameworks.
- <ins>Assignment 3</ins>: thoroughly explores image processing by constructing Transformers for image captioning, Generative Adversertial Networks (GANs) for image augmentation, and Style Transfer for image style & content transfer.
